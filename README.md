# **Ar√°n Bakehouse**
## **Description**
This is a website for a fictional bakery, located in Doolin, Co. Clare which was built as part of the Code Institute's Full Stack Developer Course. The website is primarly designed to provide the visitor with information on the business such as its offerings, location, opening hours and contact details. 

The site is readily accessible on a variety of devices and behaves in a responsive manner, accomodating all screen sizes in a way that maintains a useable and enjoyable interface.

It was designed with plain HTML and CSS only: I wanted to avoid using Javascript or even CSS libraries as I felt that a design that was coded from the bottom up would be more useful in terms of the learning experience. I did make use of a small number of technologies such as the Google Maps API, as well as Google Fonts and Fontawesome, which I felt were acceptable enough to use while still keeping the design as 'vanilla' as possible.

## **Users and Target Audience**

### **Target Audience**
The target audience is made up of both locals and visitors to the area who would like to find out if there was a place to pick up some bread, a pastry or a nice coffee. The area is quite 'touristy', with people coming to Doolin as part of a trip to the Aran Islands or a visit to the Cliffs of Moher. As the bakery is small and located off the main road, it may be easily missed, so a good online presence is essential.
